# OpenSecrets map

A HoloLens app that connects to data from the OpenSecrets website

## About

[OpenSecrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/) is an online financial report of US politicians and the companies that donate money to them. I created a scraper that pulled top contributors to current Senators and stashed the data in Azure table storage. This Unity projects reads that data using the Internet client available on the HoloLens and displays pictures and top contributors for each Senator when the user selects a state from a floating map of the country.
